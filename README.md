##  Important: Backup Your Data!

This app uses your browser’s `localStorage`.  
If you clear browser data → **your records vanish**. 😱  

So please:  
 **Export CSV weekly**  
 **Save a copy on USB or D drive**  
 Like your nani’s pickle recipe — don’t lose it!

- Hindi translation
- Better design

- Or just fixing a typo  

Let’s make this better — for every small business fighting the chaos of cash, chits, and calculations. 🙏
